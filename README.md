## üîÅ Flow Overview

1. User uploads a footballer image via web form.
2. Image is encoded in Base64 and sent to API Gateway.
3. Lambda function decodes it and calls Rekognition's `search_faces_by_image`.
4. Player name is matched and returned to the frontend.
5. Users can also suggest new players via a Formspree-powered form.
